# easy-vqa

The official Python package for the easy-VQA dataset. This package exists primarily to simplify the easy-VQA setup process.

## Installation

`pip install easy-vqa`

## Usage

```python
from easy_vqa import get_train_data, get_test_data, get_answers

'''
train_questions and test_questions are arrays of questions.
Each question is represented as an array with 3 elements:
0. The question text
1. The answer
2. The image ID
train_questions contains 38285 questions.
test_questions contains 9599 questions.

train_image_paths and test_image_paths are dicts that map
image ID to an absolute path that can be used to load the image.
train_image_paths contains 4000 image paths.
test_image_paths contains 1000 image paths.
'''
train_questions, train_image_paths = get_train_data()
test_questions, test_image_paths = get_test_data()

# Prints ['what shape does the image contain?', 'circle', 0]
print(train_questions[0])

# Prints an absolute path ending in /easy_vqa/data/train/images/0.png
print(train_image_paths[0])

'''
answers is an array of all possible answers to questions in the
easy-VQA dataset.
'''
answers = get_answers()

# Prints 'teal'
print(answers[0])
```

## Advanced User Guide

The easy-VQA dataset was generated by running

```shell
python gen_data/generate_data.py
```

which writes to the `easy_vqa/data/` directory. Be sure to install the dependencies for dataset generation running `generate_data.py`:

```shell
pip install -r gen_data/requirements.txt
```

If you want to generate a larger easy-VQA dataset, simply modify the `NUM_TRAIN` and `NUM_TEST` constants in `generate_data.py`. Otherwise, if you want to modify the dataset itself, the files and code in the `gen_data/` directory should be pretty self-explanatory.
